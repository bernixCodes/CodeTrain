# Codetrain Africa Coding Journey

Welcome to my coding journey at Codetrain Africa! This repository captures my progress over 8 weeks of intensive learning, with each week's lessons organized into separate branches labeled as `week_[number]`.

## Overview

Over the course of 8 weeks, I covered various topics in web development, including:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React



## Usage

To view the lessons for a specific week:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bernixCodes/CodeTrain.git
   ```

2. Checkout the branch corresponding to the desired week:
   ```bash
   git checkout week_one
   ```

3. Explore the files and folders to see the lessons and projects completed during that week.
